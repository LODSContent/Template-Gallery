>- Each requirement will have at least one task that a learner must perform in order to complete the requirement. You want to tell them what to do but not how to do it.
> 
>   [Task Guidance](https://lodmanuals.blob.core.windows.net/lms/CLabsInstTemplate/Instructions.png "Writing great tasks")
>
>- Create Code blocks
>
>   ```-linenums
>   
>   If there is code the learner needs to reference, put it in a "code fence".
>   Use ` ` ` and ` ` ` (without the spaces) to set the code fence that defines the code block.
>   Multiple lines of code placed in a code fence will show up as a block.
>   Define code that contains quotation marks. 
>   Code that contains quotation marks should be placed in a fenced code block or should use the Copy to clipboard or Type Text features.
